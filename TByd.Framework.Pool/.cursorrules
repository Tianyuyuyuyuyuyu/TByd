Context for the code and wider project:

I am developing a custom package related to object pooling, which I plan to publish to my personal npm repository. The goal is for multiple projects to install and share this package via Unity's Package Manager. This will allow for a more efficient and modular way of handling object pooling across various Unity projects.

Currently, I am in the process of refactoring the entire package to ensure that it is both flexible and maintainable in the long term. While the initial version of the code was written quickly, I want to make sure the architecture is scalable and easy to extend as I continue to refine the package and add new features.

The package is being developed in Unity 2021.3.8f1 using C#. I want to ensure that it integrates seamlessly with other Unity projects, and that it can be easily shared and updated across different teams and applications.

Feel free to ask any questions that would help clarify my goals and how best to improve the code and package structure.
